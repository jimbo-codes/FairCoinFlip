This application has NOT HAD ITS BACKEND TOUCHED.
-- not even db:create.
-- we have to decide how we want to deal with this database before making any decisions.

It is intended to setup a Postgresql database (confirm) to track user stats and historical wins, losses, etc.

For now, the only focus is on building out frontend MVP functionality (with a mobile first build in)



NEXT STEPS:
1. Setup the victory / loss page (formatting)
2. add a play again button (should it natively have the bet again features on page?)
3. Track the bet in state too (both the bet and selection should be sent to backend on initial click)
4. Nav bars, discord, twitter.
5. Small links at bottom (faq, etc)
6. Popup to gamble responsibly (and in right location)
7. backend
8. Account, leaderboard
